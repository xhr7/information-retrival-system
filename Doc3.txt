Data structures are important because they help organize and store data in an efficient and easily accessible way. They improve the performance of programs and 
applications, make data analysis and retrieval easier, and allow developers and programmers to access data faster and more efficiently, which helps improve the 
quality of software and applications and saves time and effort.Typical base data types, such as integers or floating-point values, that are available in most computer
programming languages are generally insufficient to capture the logical intent for data processing and use. Yet applications that ingest, manipulate and produce
information must understand how data should be organized to simplify processing. Data structures bring together the data elements in a logical way and facilitate
the effective use, persistence and sharing of data. They provide a formal model that describes the way the data elements are organized.
