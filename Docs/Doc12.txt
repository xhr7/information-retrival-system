Saffron, a spice derived from the dried stigmas of the saffron crocus , has remained among the world's most costly substances throughout history. With its bitter
taste, hay-like fragrance, and slight metallic notes, saffron has been used as a seasoning, fragrance, dye, and medicine. Saffron is native to Southwest Asia 
but was first cultivated in Greece. Saffronâ€™s exorbitant cost is due to the laborious task of harvesting. First, farmers separate the delicate strands from 
each flower manually. Then, they heat and cure the threads to enhance their flavour. The extra labour amounts to the cost and benefits of saffron. Hence, it 
is also known as the king of spices.
