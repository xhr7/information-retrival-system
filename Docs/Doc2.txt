The history of data structures dates back to the early days of computer programming. One of the earliest data structures was the array, which was used in FORTRAN
in the 1950s. The linked list was introduced in the 1960s, followed by the stack and queue. In the 1970s, the tree data structure was developed, and in the 1980s,
the hash table was introduced. Today, there are many different types of data structures, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. The development of data 
structures has played a crucial role in the evolution of computer programming and software engineering. The development of data structures has been driven by the need 
for efficient storage and retrieval of data in computer programs. As programs became more complex, the need for more sophisticated data structures grew. One of the most 
significant advances in data structures was the introduction of object-oriented programming in the 1980s. Object-oriented programming allowed for the creation of complex
data structures that could be easily reused and modified. Today, data structures are used in a wide range of applications, from databases and search engines to video games
and mobile apps. The study of data structures is an important part of computer science education, and understanding them is essential for developing efficient software.
