Basically, data structures are divided into two categories Linear data structure and Non-linear data structure The main difference between linear and non-linear
data structures is the way in which they organize and store data.Linear data structures store data elements in a linear sequence, where each element is connected 
to its previous and next element. Examples of linear data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. Linear data structures are useful when data 
needs to be accessed sequentially, or when data elements need to be added or removed from one end of the structure.Non-linear data structures, on the other hand, 
do not store data elements in a linear sequence. Instead, data elements are organized in a hierarchical or network-like structure. Examples of non-linear data 
structures include trees and graphs. Non-linear data structures are useful when data needs to be organized based on relationships between data elements, or when 
data needs to be accessed in a non-sequential manner.
