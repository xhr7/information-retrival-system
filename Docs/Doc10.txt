Graphs are non-linear data structures that are made up of a set of nodes (or vertices), connected by edges (or arcs). Nodes are entities where the data is stored
and their relationships are expressed using edges. Edges may be directed or undirected. Graphs demonstrate complicated relationships with ease and are used to
solve many real-life problems.The most common types of graphs in the data structure are Undirected graph, Directed graph, Weighted Graph, Unweighted .Graphs are 
powerful data structures that represent real-life relationships between entities. Graphs are used everywhere, from social networks, Google maps, and the world wide
web to blockchains and neural networks. Due to their ability to provide abstractions to real-life, they are used in a variety of practical problems.
