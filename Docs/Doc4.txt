Data structures are used in a wide range of applications, including Databases: Data structures such as B-trees and hash tables are used to efficiently store
and retrieve large amounts of data , Search engines: Data structures such as inverted indexes are used to quickly search through large collections of documents,
Video games: Data structures such as graphs and trees are used to represent game worlds and game mechanics,Operating systems: Data structures such as linked lists
and queues are used to manage system resources such as memory and processes, Mobile apps: Data structures such as arrays and maps are used to store and manipulate 
data in mobile applications, Artificial intelligence: Data structures such as decision trees and neural networks are used in machine learning and other AI applications,
Web development: Data structures such as stacks and queues are used to manage web server requests and responses.These are just a few examples of the many applications 
of data structures in computer programming and software engineering.
