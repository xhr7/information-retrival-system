a queue is is a type of linear data structure that stores a collection of elements  is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items happens
at one end, called the “rear,” and the removal of existing items occurs at the other end, commonly called the “front.” As an element enters the queue it starts
at the rear and makes its way toward the front, waiting until that time when it is the next element to be removed.The most recently added item in the queue must
wait at the end of the collection. The item that has been in the collection the longest is at the front. This ordering principle is sometimes called FIFO, first-in
first-out. It is also known as “first-come first-served".The simplest example of a queue is the typical line that we all participate in from time to time. We wait
in a line for a movie, we wait in the check-out line at a grocery store, and we wait in the cafeteria line (so that we can pop the tray stack). Well-behaved lines,
or queues, are very restrictive in that they have only one way in and only one way out. Queues are commonly used in programming languages to manage tasks that need
to be performed in a specific order, such as printing jobs or processing requests. Queues can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.
