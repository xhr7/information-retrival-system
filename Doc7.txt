stack is a type of linear data structure that stores a collection of elements  is a logical concept that consists of a set of similar elements. The term is 
often used in programming and memory organization in computers. Programming stacks are based on the principle of last in first out (LIFO), a commonly used type
of data abstract that consists of two major operations, push and pop. The push operation adds an element to the bottom of stack while the pop operation removes
an element from the top position.Software implementations of the stack concept are done using arrays and linked lists where the top position is tracked using 
a variable or header pointer respectively. Many programming languages provide built-in features to support stack implementation. Stack is used in many software 
applications, including artificial intelligence applications, animation applications, medical applications, and banking and financial applications.is also used
in many programming languages
