An array is a  linear data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type. In Computer Programming,an array assembles equivalent data 
elements stored at adjacent memory locations. It is a fixed-size container that can hold a specific number of elements of the same data type , This easiest 
data structure helps to determine the location of each piece of data by simply using an offset to the base value. An offset is a number that illustrates the
distinction between two index numbers.For instance, If you want to keep a record of the marks obtained by a student in 6 subjects, then you donâ€™t need to determine
the variables individually. Rather, you can determine an array that will store each piece of data factors at a contiguous memory location.Arrays are one of the oldest
and most essential data structures used in almost every program. Arrays are also useful in implementing other data structures such as lists, heaps, hash tables, 
deques, queues, stacks, and strings.
