There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, \n","all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose. Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with the data they need in appropriate ways. \n","Most importantly, data structures frame the organization of information so that machines and humans can better understand it.In computer science and computer \n","programming, a data structure may be selected or designed to store data for the purpose of using it with various algorithms. In some cases, the algorithm's basic \n","operations are tightly coupled to the data structure's design. Each data structure contains information about the data values, relationships between the data\n","and -- in some cases -- functions that can be applied to the data. \n","\n","2 - The history of data structures dates back to the early days of computer programming. One of the earliest data structures was the array, which was used in FORTRAN\n","in the 1950s. The linked list was introduced in the 1960s, followed by the stack and queue. In the 1970s, the tree data structure was developed, and in the 1980s,\n","the hash table was introduced. Today, there are many different types of data structures, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. The development of data \n","structures has played a crucial role in the evolution of computer programming and software engineering. The development of data structures has been driven by the need \n","for efficient storage and retrieval of data in computer programs. As programs became more complex, the need for more sophisticated data structures grew. One of the most \n","significant advances in data structures was the introduction of object-oriented programming in the 1980s. Object-oriented programming allowed for the creation of complex\n","data structures that could be easily reused and modified. Today, data structures are used in a wide range of applications, from databases and search engines to video games\n","and mobile apps. The study of data structures is an important part of computer science education, and understanding them is essential for developing efficient software. \n","\n","3 - Data structures are important because they help organize and store data in an efficient and easily accessible way. They improve the performance of programs and \n","applications, make data analysis and retrieval easier, and allow developers and programmers to access data faster and more efficiently, which helps improve the \n","quality of software and applications and saves time and effort.Typical base data types, such as integers or floating-point values, that are available in most computer\n","programming languages are generally insufficient to capture the logical intent for data processing and use. Yet applications that ingest, manipulate and produce\n","information must understand how data should be organized to simplify processing. Data structures bring together the data elements in a logical way and facilitate\n","the effective use, persistence and sharing of data. They provide a formal model that describes the way the data elements are organized. \n","\n","4 - Data structures are used in a wide range of applications, including Databases: Data structures such as B-trees and hash tables are used to efficiently store\n","and retrieve large amounts of data , Search engines: Data structures such as inverted indexes are used to quickly search through large collections of documents,\n","Video games: Data structures such as graphs and trees are used to represent game worlds and game mechanics,Operating systems: Data structures such as linked lists\n","and queues are used to manage system resources such as memory and processes, Mobile apps: Data structures such as arrays and maps are used to store and manipulate \n","data in mobile applications, Artificial intelligence: Data structures such as decision trees and neural networks are used in machine learning and other AI applications,\n","Web development: Data structures such as stacks and queues are used to manage web server requests and responses.These are just a few examples of the many applications \n","of data structures in computer programming and software engineering. \n","\n","5 - Basically, data structures are divided into two categories Linear data structure and Non-linear data structure The main difference between linear and non-linear\n","data structures is the way in which they organize and store data.Linear data structures store data elements in a linear sequence, where each element is connected \n","to its previous and next element. Examples of linear data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. Linear data structures are useful when data \n","needs to be accessed sequentially, or when data elements need to be added or removed from one end of the structure.Non-linear data structures, on the other hand, \n","do not store data elements in a linear sequence. Instead, data elements are organized in a hierarchical or network-like structure. Examples of non-linear data \n","structures include trees and graphs. Non-linear data structures are useful when data needs to be organized based on relationships between data elements, or when \n","data needs to be accessed in a non-sequential manner. \n","\n","6 - An array is a  linear data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type. In Computer Programming,an array assembles equivalent data \n","elements stored at adjacent memory locations. It is a fixed-size container that can hold a specific number of elements of the same data type , This easiest \n","data structure helps to determine the location of each piece of data by simply using an offset to the base value. An offset is a number that illustrates the\n","distinction between two index numbers.For instance, If you want to keep a record of the marks obtained by a student in 6 subjects, then you don’t need to determine\n","the variables individually. Rather, you can determine an array that will store each piece of data factors at a contiguous memory location.Arrays are one of the oldest\n","and most essential data structures used in almost every program. Arrays are also useful in implementing other data structures such as lists, heaps, hash tables, \n","deques, queues, stacks, and strings. \n","\n","7 - stack is a type of linear data structure that stores a collection of elements  is a logical concept that consists of a set of similar elements. The term is \n","often used in programming and memory organization in computers. Programming stacks are based on the principle of last in first out (LIFO), a commonly used type\n","of data abstract that consists of two major operations, push and pop. The push operation adds an element to the bottom of stack while the pop operation removes\n","an element from the top position.Software implementations of the stack concept are done using arrays and linked lists where the top position is tracked using \n","a variable or header pointer respectively. Many programming languages provide built-in features to support stack implementation. Stack is used in many software \n","applications, including artificial intelligence applications, animation applications, medical applications, and banking and financial applications.is also used\n","in many programming languages \n","\n","8 - a queue is is a type of linear data structure that stores a collection of elements  is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items happens\n","at one end, called the “rear,” and the removal of existing items occurs at the other end, commonly called the “front.” As an element enters the queue it starts\n","at the rear and makes its way toward the front, waiting until that time when it is the next element to be removed.The most recently added item in the queue must\n","wait at the end of the collection. The item that has been in the collection the longest is at the front. This ordering principle is sometimes called FIFO, first-in\n","first-out. It is also known as “first-come first-served\".The simplest example of a queue is the typical line that we all participate in from time to time. We wait\n","in a line for a movie, we wait in the check-out line at a grocery store, and we wait in the cafeteria line (so that we can pop the tray stack). Well-behaved lines,\n","or queues, are very restrictive in that they have only one way in and only one way out. Queues are commonly used in programming languages to manage tasks that need\n","to be performed in a specific order, such as printing jobs or processing requests. Queues can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. \n","\n","9 - tree data structure is a collection of nodes connected by edges. Each node contains a value or data which may or may not have a child node. The first node of\n","the tree is called the root. If this root node is connected with another node, then this root is called the parent node, and the node connected to it is the \n","child node. When operations are performed in a linear data structure, the complexity rises as the data size increases. On the other hand, the tree data structure\n","provides much quicker access to the data, which is non-linear. Trees are commonly used to represent hierarchical relationships, such as file systems, organization \n","charts, and HTML documents. There are many different types of trees, such as binary trees. \n","\n","10 - Graphs are non-linear data structures that are made up of a set of nodes (or vertices), connected by edges (or arcs). Nodes are entities where the data is stored\n","and their relationships are expressed using edges. Edges may be directed or undirected. Graphs demonstrate complicated relationships with ease and are used to\n","solve many real-life problems.The most common types of graphs in the data structure are Undirected graph, Directed graph, Weighted Graph, Unweighted .Graphs are \n","powerful data structures that represent real-life relationships between entities. Graphs are used everywhere, from social networks, Google maps, and the world wide\n","web to blockchains and neural networks. Due to their ability to provide abstractions to real-life, they are used in a variety of practical problems. \n","\n","11 - Birds are vertebrate animals adapted for flight. Many can also run, jump, swim, and dive. Some, like penguins, have lost the ability to fly but retained their\n","wings. Birds are found worldwide and in all habitats. The largest is the nine-foot-tall ostrich. The smallest is the two-inch-long bee hummingbird. Everything\n","about the anatomy of a bird reflects its ability to fly. The wings, for example, are shaped to create lift. The leading edge is thicker than the back edge, and \n","they are covered in feathers that narrow to a point. Airplane wings are modeled after bird wings.Birds have a unique digestive system that allows them to eat when \n","they can—usually on the fly—and digest later.  \n","\n","12 - Saffron, a spice derived from the dried stigmas of the saffron crocus , has remained among the world's most costly substances throughout history. With its bitter\n","taste, hay-like fragrance, and slight metallic notes, saffron has been used as a seasoning, fragrance, dye, and medicine. Saffron is native to Southwest Asia \n","but was first cultivated in Greece. Saffron’s exorbitant cost is due to the laborious task of harvesting. First, farmers separate the delicate strands from \n","each flower manually. Then, they heat and cure the threads to enhance their flavour. The extra labour amounts to the cost and benefits of saffron. Hence, it \n","is also known as the king of spices. \n","\n","new text after pre pre-prociessing : \n","\n","1 - data structur special format organ process retriev store data sever basic advanc type
